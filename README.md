Management Information 
System
 ECCILO 7013
What Is MIS?
 Management information system or MIS is a set of procedures 
that provides essential data and information to the management 
for making an informed decision. 
The Management information system 
involves:
 ● Collection of appropriate data from various reliable sources.
 ● Processing of such data to extract the relevant and useful 
information.
 ● Delivering this information to the respective department.
Why MIS Is Important For Businesses?
 The corporate environment is dynamic involving uncertainties 
and risks. These uncertainties and risks drive business 
organizations to take complicated decision to survive in the 
market.
 The primary goal of any organization is to improve its 
profitability and sustain in the long run. Hence, any business 
establishment cannot afford to ignore the importance of MIS.
 Management information system report plays a crucial role in 
improving performance, productivity, and profitability of the 
organization. 
Information Technology (IT): any 
computer-based tool that people use to work with 
information and to support the information and 
information-processing needs of an organization.
 Information System (IS): collects, processes, 
stores, analyzes, and disseminates information for 
a specific purpose.

Data–Information–Knowledge
 Data Items: an elementary description of things, events, 
activities, and transactions that are recorded, classified, 
and stored but are not organized to convey any specific 
meaning.Eg.
 Information: refers to data that have been organized so 
that they have meaning and value to the recipient.Eg.
 Knowledge: consists of data and/or information that have 
been organized and processed to convey understanding, 
experience, accumulated learning, and expertise as they 
apply to a current business problem.Eg.
Computer based information 
Systems
 Computer-based information system (CBIS) is an 
information system that uses computer technology to 
perform some or all of its intended tasks. Although not all 
information systems are computerized, today most are. 
For this reason the term “information system” is typically 
used synonymously with “computer-based information 
system.”
 Components of a CBIS
 •Hardware
 •Software
 •Database
 •Network
 •Procedures
 •People
Components of a CBIS
 • Hardware: consists of devices such as the processor, 
monitor, keyboard, and printer.
 • Software: a program or collection of programs that enable 
the hardware to process data.
 • Database: a collection of related files or tables containing 
data.
 • Network: a connecting system (wireline or wireless) that 
permits different computers to share resources.
 • Procedures: are the instructions for combining the above 
components to process information and generate the 
desired output.
 • People: individuals who use the hardware and software, 
interface with it, or utilize its output.
Computer based information 
Systems
 These components are integrated to form the wide variety 
of information systems found within an organization.
Information Technology

IT Infrastructure
 ● IT components of hardware, software, networks (wireline 
and wireless), and databases form the information 
technology platform. 
● IT personnel use these components to develop
 information systems, oversee security and risk, and 
manage data. These activities cumulatively are called 
information technology services. 
● The IT components plus IT services comprise the
 organization’s information technology infrastructure. 
● At the top of the pyramid are the various
 organizational information systems.
Capabilities of Computer-Based 
Information Systems (CBIS)
 ● Perform high-speed, high-volume numerical 
computations.
 ● Provide fast, accurate communication and collaboration 
within and among organizations.
 ● Store huge amounts of information in an easy-to-access, 
yet small space.
 ● Allow quick and inexpensive access to vast amounts of 
information, worldwide.
 ● Interpret vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

 •Expert Systems (ES)
 •Dashboards
Knowledge Workers: professional employees that are 
experts in a particular subject area (e.g., financial and 
marketing analysts, engineers, lawyers, and accountants.).
 Office Automation Systems (OASs): typically support the 
clerical staff, lower and middle managers, and knowledge 
workers (e.g., word processing and desktop publishing 
software).
 Business Intelligence (BI) Systems: systems that provide 
computer-based support for complex, nonroutine decisions, 
primarily for middle managers and knowledge workers.
 Expert Systems (ES): systems that attempt to duplicate the 
work of human experts by applying reasoning capabilities, 
knowledge, and expertise within a specific domain.
 Dashboards: a special form of IS that support all managers 
of the organization by providing rapid access to timely 
information and direct access to structured information in the 
form of reports.

Business Pressures, 
Organizational Responses, 
and IT Support
 2.1
 Modern organizations compete in a challenging 
environment. To remain competitive, organisations 
must react rapidly to problems and opportunities 
that arise from extremely dynamic conditions. For 
eg. 
•Competitive Advantage
 •Business Environment
 •Business Pressures
 •Organizational Responses
Competitive Advantage: any assets that provide an 
organization with an edge against its competitors in some 
measure such as cost, quality, or speed. It also helps an 
organization to control a market and to accrue 
larger-than-average profits.
 Business Environment: the combination of social, legal, 
economic, physical, and political factors in which businesses 
conduct their operations. Significant changes in any of these 
factors are likely to create Business Pressures on 
organizations.
 Organizations Responses: Organizations respond to the 
various pressures by implementing Information Technology 
(IT) such as strategic systems, customer focus, 
make-to-order and mass customization, and e-business.
Business Pressures
 The business environment is the combination of 
social, legal, economic, physical, and political factors 
in which businesses conduct their operations.
 They are classified as:
 •Market Pressures
 •Technology Pressures
 •Societal/Political/Legal Pressures
Market Pressures: business pressures generated by the 
global economy, intense competition, the changing nature 
of the workforce, and powerful customers.
 Technology Pressures: business pressures caused by 
technological innovation and information overload.
 Societal/Political/Legal Pressures: business pressures 
related to social responsibility, government 
regulation/deregulation, spending for social programs, 
spending to protect against terrorism, and ethics.

Organizational Performance & 
Responses, and IT Support
Market Pressures
 •Globalization
 •Changing Nature of the Workforce
 •Powerful Customers
Globalization: the integration and interdependence of 
economic, social, cultural, and ecological facets of life, 
made possible by rapid advances in information 
technology.
 Changing Nature of the Workforce: The workforce, 
particularly in developed countries, is becoming more 
diversified. Increasing numbers of women, single parents, 
minorities, and persons with disabilities are now employed 
in all types of positions.
 Powerful Customers: consumer sophistication and 
expectations increase as customers become more 
knowledgeable about the products and services they 
acquire. Customers can use the Internet to find detailed 
information about products and services, to compare 
prices, and to purchase items at electronic auctions.

 •Technological Innovation and 
Obsolescence
 •Information Overload
Technological Innovation and Obsolescence: 
Few and improved technologies rapidly create or 
support substitutes for products, alternative 
service options, and superb quality. As a result, 
today’s state-of-the-art products may be obsolete 
tomorrow.
 Information Overload: 
Internet and other telecommunications networks 
are bringing a flood of information to managers. 
To make decisions effectively and efficiently, 
managers must be able to access, navigate, and 
utilize these vast stores of data, information, and 
knowledge.

Societal/Political/Legal 
Pressures 
Includes social responsibility, government 
regulation/deregulation, spending for social 
programs, spending to protect against 
terrorism, and ethics.
 They are : 
•Social Responsibility
 •Compliance with Government Regulations
 •Protection Against Terrorist Attacks
 •Ethical Issues
Social Responsibility
 •IT Assists “Go Green” Efforts in 
Three Areas:
 1. Facilities design and management
 2. Carbon management
 3. International and U.S. environmental 
laws
 •Digital Divide
Social Responsibility: 
● Social issues that affect businesses and individuals range from the 
state of the physical environment, to company and individual 
philanthropy, to education. Some corporations and individuals 
are willing to spend time and/or money to address various social 
problems. These efforts are known as organizational social 
responsibility or individual social responsibility.
 ● A growing IT initiative, called green IT, is addressing some of the 
most pressing environmental concerns such as:
 Facilities design and management: 
● Organizations are creating more sustainable work environments. 
Many organizations are pursuing Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the U.S. 
● Green Building Council, a nonprofit group that promotes the 
construction of environmentally friendly buildings. 
● IT professionals are expected to help create green facilities. IT 
personnel have to consider how their computing decisions 
influences sustainable design and, in turn, how the building’s 
design influences the IT infrastructure. Green design influences 
the type of IT devices a company uses and the locations where IT 
clusters personal computers, people, and servers.
 Carbon mgmt:
 IT executives to develop the systems needed to monitor carbon 
throughout the organization and its supply chain, which can be global 
in scope. Therefore, IT employees need to become knowledgeable 
about embedded carbon and how to measure it in the company’s 
products and processes.
 International and U.S. state environmental laws: 
IT executives must deal with federal and state laws and international 
regulations that impact everything from the IT products they buy, to 
how they dispose of them, to their company’s carbon footprint. 
IT managers must understand environmental compliance issues so 
they can ask their vendors the right questions regarding specific state,
national, and international environmental standards before they 
purchase, deploy, and dispose of equipment.
 Energy management:
 IT executives must understand their entire organization’s energy
 needs for several reasons by offering incentives to commercial 
customers who take certain energy conservation steps, such as 
enabling computer power management across their networks and 
designing energy-efficient data centers.
 Still another social problem that affects modern business is the digital 
divide. The digital divide refers to the wide gap between those 
individuals who have access to information and communications 
technology and those who do not. This gap exists both within and 
among countries.
 Compliance with Government Regulations: 
Government regulations regarding health, safety, environmental 
protection, and equal opportunity. Businesses tend to view 
government regulations as expensive constraints on their activities. In 
general, government deregulation intensifies competition. 
Protection Against Terrorist Attacks: 
Since September 11, 2001, organizations have been under increased 
pressure to protect themselves against terrorist attacks. In addition, 
employees who are in the military reserves have been called up for active 
duty, creating personnel problems. Information technology can help 
protect businesses by providing security systems and possibly 
identifying patterns of behavior associated with terrorist activities, 
including cyberattacks.
 Ethical Issues: 
Ethics relates to general standards of right and wrong. Information 
ethics relates specifically to standards of right and wrong in 
information processing practices. Ethical issues are very important 
because, if handled poorly, they can damage an organization’s image 
and destroy its employees’ morale.The use of IT raises many ethical 
issues, ranging from monitoring e-mail to invading the privacy of 
millions of customers whose data are stored in private and public 
databases.

Organizational Responses
 •Strategic Systems
 •Customer Focus
 •Make-to-Order and Mass 
Customization
 •E-Business and E-Commerce
Strategic Systems: provide organizations with advantages that enable them 
to increase their market share and/or profits, to better negotiate with suppliers, 
and to prevent competitors from entering their markets.
 Customer Focus: Organizational attempts to provide superb customer 
service can make the difference between attracting and retaining customers 
versus losing them to competitors. Numerous IT tools and business processes 
have been designed to keep customers happy.
 Make-to-Order: a strategy of producing customized (made to individual 
specifications) products and services.
 Mass Customization: a company produces a large quantity of items, but it 
customizes them to match the needs and preferences of individual customers. 
Mass customization is essentially an attempt to perform make-to-order on a 
large scale (Example: Bodymetrics <www.bodymetrics.com>).
 E-Business and E-Commerce: Conducting business electronically is an 
essential strategy for companies that are competing in today’s business 
environment.
 Electronic commerce (EC or e-commerce): describes the process of 
buying, selling, transferring, or exchanging products, services, or information 
via computer networks, including the Internet.
 E-business: a somewhat broader concept than EC that includes servicing 
customers, collaborating with business partners, and performing electronic 
transactions within an organization.

Competitive Advantage and 
Strategic IS’s
 A competitive strategy is a statement that identifies 
a business’s approach to compete, its goals, and the 
plans and policies that will be required to carry out 
those goals (Porter,1985).
 Strategic information systems(SISs)
 Provide a competitive advantage by helping an 
organization implement its strategic goals and 
improve its performance and productivity. Any 
information system that helps an organization either 
achieve a competitive advantage or reduce a 
competitive disadvantage,qualifies as a strategic 
information system.
Competitive Advantage and 
Strategic IS’s
 •Porter’s Competitive Forces Model
 •Porter’s Value Chain Model
 •Strategies for Competitive Advantage
 •Business – Information Technology 
Alignment
Porter’s Five Forces Model:
 Porter’s model identifies five major forces that 
can endanger or enhance a company’s position 
in a given industry.They are:
 1. The threat of new competitors
 2. The bargaining power of suppliers
 3. The bargaining power of customers 
(buyers)
 4. The threat of substitute products or 
services
 5. The rivalry among existing firms in 
the industry
Threat of Entry of New Competitors: The threat that new competitors will 
enter your market is high when entry is easy and low when there are 
significant barriers to entry.
 Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Supplier power is high when buyers have 
few choices from whom to buy and low when buyers have many choices.
 Bargaining Power of Customers (Buyers): Buyer power is high when 
buyers have many choices from whom to buy and low when buyers have few 
choices.
 Threat of Substitute Products or Services: If there are many alternatives to 
an organization’s products or services, then the threat of substitutes is high. If 
there are few alternatives, then the threat is low.
 Rivalry Among Existing Firms: The threat from rivalry is high when there is 
intense competition among many firms in an industry. The threat is low when 
the competition is among fewer firms and is not as intense.--------------------
Barrier to Entry: a product or service feature that customers have learned to 
expect from organizations in a certain industry. A competing organization must 
offer this feature in order to survive in the marketplace (e.g., legal 
requirements such as admission to the bar to practice law).
 Switching Costs: the costs, in money and time, imposed by a decision to buy 
elsewhere (e.g., contracts with smartphone providers).
Figure 2.2: Porter’s 
Competitive Forces Model
Porter’s Value Chain Model
 • Value Chain:
 A value chain is a sequence of activities through which the 
organization’s inputs, whatever they are, are transformed into more 
valuable outputs, whatever they are. 
• The value chain model: identifies points where an organization can 
use information technology to achieve competitive advantage (see 
above Figure).
 According to Porter’s value chain model, the activities conducted in any 
organization can be
 divided into two categories:–Primary Activities–Support Activities
Primary Activities 
relate to the production and distribution of the firm’s products and 
services. These activities create value for which customers are willing 
to pay.Manufacturing companies typically perform five primary 
activities in the following sequence:
 •Inbound logistics
 •Operations
 •Outbound logistics
 •Marketing and sales
 •Services
Support Activities
 •The Firm’s Infrastructure
 •Human Resources Management
 •Product and Technology 
Development
 •Procurement

Chain Model
Strategies for Competitive 
Advantage

 2. Differentiation strategy
 3. Innovation strategy
 4. Organizational effectiveness

 5. Customer orientation strategy
Strategies for Competitive Advantage :
 Organizations continually try to develop strategies 
to counter the five competitive forces identified by 
Porter.The commonly used strategies are :
Competitive Advantage Strategies:
 1. Cost leadership strategy: Produce products and/or services at the 
lowest cost in the industry (e.g., Walmart’s automatic inventory 
replenishment system).
 2. Differentiation Strategy: Offering different products, services, or 
product features than your competitors (e.g., Southwest Airlines has 
differentiated itself as a low-cost, short-haul, express airline).
 3. Innovation Strategy: Introduce new products and services, add new 
features to existing products and services, or develop new ways to 
produce them (Classic Example: the first introduction of automated teller 
machines (ATMs) by Citibank).
 4. Operational Effectiveness Strategy: Improve the manner in which a 
firm executes its internal business processes so that it performs these 
activities more effectively than its rivals. Such improvements increase 
quality, productivity, and employee and customer satisfaction while 
decreasing time to market.
 5. Customer Orientation Strategy: Concentrate on making customers 
happy. Web-based systems are particularly effective in this area because 
they can create a personalized, one-to-one relationship with each 
customer.

The Manager’s Job and 
Decision Making
 •Management: a process by which an organization 
achieves its goals through the use of resources 
(people, money, materials, and information).
 •Three Basic Roles of Managers (Mintzberg, 
1973):
 1.Interpersonal roles: figurehead, leader, liaison
 2.Informational roles: monitor, disseminator, 
spokesperson, analyzer
 3.Decisional roles: entrepreneur, disturbance 
handler, resource allocator, negotiator
•
 Decision is  a choice among two or 
more alternatives that individuals 
and groups make. 
•
 Decisions are diverse and are made 
continuously.
 •
 Decision making is a systematic 
process.
The Process and Phases in 
Decision Making
 Phases of the Decision Making Process:
 •Intelligence Phase: managers examine a situation and then 
identify and define the problem or opportunity.
 •Design Phase: decision makers construct a model for addressing 
the situation. They perform this task by making assumptions that 
simplify reality and by expressing the relationships among all of the 
relevant variables. 
•Choice Phase: involves selecting a solution or course of action that 
seems best suited to resolve the problem. This solution (the 
decision) is then implemented.
 •Implementation Phase: is successful if the proposed solution 
solves the problem or seizes the opportunity. If the solution fails, 
then the process returns to the previous phases. Computer-based 
decision support assists managers in the decision-making process.
 The Process and Phases in 
Decision Making

Why Managers Need IT 
Support?
 Decision making is difficult due to the 
following trends:
 ● The number of alternatives is constantly 
increasing
 ●Most decisions are made under time 
constraints
 ●Uncertainty in the decision environment
 ●Group decision making required
What IT are Available to

 •Business Intelligence (BI): is a broad category of 
applications, technologies, and processes for gathering, 
storing, accessing, and analyzing data to help business 
users make better decisions. 
•BI applications enable decision makers to quickly ascertain 
the status of a business enterprise by examining key 
information.
A Framework for 
Computerized Decision 
Analysis
 Problem Structure: where decision-making 
processes fall along a range  from highly structured 
to highly unstructured.
 Nature of Decisions: 
•All managerial decisions fall into one of three broad 
categories:–Operational Control: executing specific tasks 
efficiently and effectively.–Management Control: acquiring and using resources 
efficiently in accomplishing organizational goals.–Strategic Planning: the long-range goals and 
policies for growth and resource allocation.
Decision Support Framework
Problem Structure:
 Structured decisions deal with routine and repetitive problems for 
which standard solutions exist, such as inventory control. In a 
structured decision, the first three phases of the decision 
process—intelligence, design, and choice—are laid out in a particular 
sequence, and the procedures for obtaining the best (or at least a good 
enough) solution are known.-Two basic criteria used to evaluate proposed solutions are minimizing 
costs and maximizing profits. -These types of decisions are candidates for decision automation. 
Unstructured decisions: These decisions are intended to deal with 
“fuzzy,” complex problems for which there are no cut-and-dried 
solutions. -An unstructured decision is one in which there is no standardized 
procedure for carrying out any of the three phases. In making such a 
decision, human intuition and judgment often play an important role.-Typical unstructured decisions include planning new service 
offerings, hiring an executive, and choosing a set of research and 
development (R&D) projects for the coming year. 
Although BI cannot make unstructured decisions, it can provide
 information that assists decision makers
Semistructured decisions require a combination of standard 
solution procedures and individual judgment. -Examples of semistructured decisions are evaluating employees, 
setting marketing budgets for consumer products, performing 
capital acquisition analysis, and trading bonds
 The Decision Matrix: The three primary classes of problem 
structure and the three broad categories of the nature of 
decisions can be combined in a decision-support matrix that 
consists of nine cells, as diagrammed in Figure 12.2. -Lower-level managers usually perform tasks in cells 1, 2, and 4. -The tasks in cells 3, 5, and 7 are usually the responsibility of 
middle managers and professional staff. -Finally, tasks in cells 6, 8, and 9 are generally carried out by 
senior executives.
Decision Support Framework

The Scope of Business 
Intelligence
 • The use of BI in organizations varies considerably. In 
smaller organizations, BI may be limited to Excel 
spreadsheets. In larger ones, BI often is enterprise wide, 
and it includes applications such as data mining/predictive 
analytics, dashboards, and data visualization. 
• It is important to recognize that the importance of BI to 
organizations continues to grow.
The Scope of Business Intelligence
 BI often is enterprise wide, and it includes applications
 such as data mining/predictive analytics, dashboards, and data 
visualization.
 In this section you will examine three specific BI targets that 
represent different levels of change:
 •The Development of One or a Few Related BI Applications
 •The Development of Infrastructure to Support Enterprise Wide BI
 •Support for the Organizational Transformation
The Development of One or a Few Related BI Applications. 
● This BI target often is a point solution for a departmental need, such 
as campaign management in marketing. 
● Sponsorship, approval, funding, impacts, and benefits typically occur 
at the departmental level. For this target, organizations usually 
create a data mart to store the necessary data.
 The Development of Infrastructure to Support Enterprise wide 
BI. 
● This BI target supports both current and future BI needs.
 ● A crucial component of BI at this level is an enterprise data 
warehouse. Because it is an enterprisewide initiative, senior 
management often provides sponsorship, approval, and funding. In 
addition, the impacts and benefits are felt throughout the 
organization
Support for Organizational 
Transformation
 ● BI is used to fundamentally transform the ways in which a 
company competes in the marketplace. 
● BI supports a new business model, and it enables the business 
strategy. Because of the scope and importance of these changes, 
critical elements such as sponsorship, approval, and funding 
originate at the highest organizational levels. 
● The impact on personnel and processes can be significant, and 
the benefits are organization wide.

Business Intelligence 
Applications for Data Analysis
 ● A good strategy to study the ways in which 
organizations use business intelligence applications is to 
consider how the users analyze data, how they present 
the results of their analyses, and how managers and 
executives (who can also be users) implement these 
results.
 ● As we know that the data are stored in a data 
warehouse or data mart. 
● The user community analyzes these data employing a 
variety of BI applications given below:
 •Multidimensional Analysis or Online Analytical 
Processing
 •Data Mining
 •Decision Support Systems
Multidimensional Analysis or 
Online Analytical Processing
 •Online Analytical Processing (OLAP - also 
referred to as multidimensional analysis) 
capabilities. 
•OLAP involves “slicing and dicing” data stored 
in a dimensional format, drilling down in the 
data to greater detail, and aggregating the 
data.
Example:Figure 3.5: 
Relational Databases
Figure 3.6: Data Cube
Data Mining
 •Data Mining: the process of searching for valuable business 
information in a large database, data warehouse, or data 
mart. 
•Data Mining Can Perform Two Basic Operations:
 (1) predicting trends and behaviors
 (2) identifying previously unknown patterns
 •Elaborate with egs
● Data mining automates the process of finding predictive 
information in large databases. 
● Questions that traditionally required extensive hands-on 
analysis now can be answered directly and quickly from 
the data. 
● For example, targeted marketing relies on predictive 
information.
 ● Numerous data mining applications are used in business 
and in other fields. According to a Gartner report 
(www.gartner.com), most Fortune 1000 companies 
worldwide currently use data mining, as the following 
representative examples illustrate. 
● Note that in most cases the purpose of data mining is to 
identify a business opportunity to create a sustainable 
competitive advantage.
●Retailing and sales
 ●Banking
 ●Manufacturing and production
 ● Insurance 
●Policework
 ●Healthcare 
●Marketing
Decision Support Systems 
(DSS)
 •Decision support systems (DSS) are interactive 
software-based systems that help managers in 
decision-making by accessing large volumes of 
information generated from various related information 
systems 
•DSS uses the summary information, exceptions, patterns, 
and trends using the analytical models. 
•A decision support system helps in decision-making but 
does not necessarily give a decision itself. 
•The decision makers compile useful information from raw 
data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or business 
models to identify and solve problems and make 
decisions.
DSS Capabilities
 •Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analysis is the study of the impact 
that changes in one or more parts of a decision-making model have on 
other parts.
 •What–If Analysis: This analysis attempts to predict impact of 
assumptions (input data) on the proposed solution. The results depend 
on the accuracy of these assumptions, which can be highly subjective.
 •Goal-Seeking Analysis: represents a “backward” solution approach. 
It attempts to calculate the value of the inputs necessary to achieve a 
desired level of output.
Business Intelligence Applications 
for Presenting Results
 •
 Dashboard: provides easy access to timely information and 
direct access to management reports. They evolved from 
executive information systems, which were information 
systems designed specifically for the information needs of top 
executives
 •
 Data Visualization: data presented to users in visual formats 
such as text, graphics, and tables following data processing. 
Data Visualization makes IT applications more attractive and 
understandable to users.
 •
 Real-Time Business Intelligence: includes the use of real 
time data for analysis as it is created rather than using 
historical data for analysis.

 •Geographic Information System (GIS): a 
computer-based system for capturing, integrating, 
manipulating, and displaying data using digitized 
maps. Its most distinguishing characteristic is that 
every record or digital object has an identified 
geographical location.
 •Reality Mining: Graphical Information Systems 
(GIS) and Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) 
together to produce an interesting new type of 
technology which allows analysts to extract 
information from the usage patterns of mobile 
phones and other wireless devices.
Real-Time BI
 •Until recently, BI focused on the use of historical data. 
This focus has changed with the emergence of 
technology for capturing, storing, and using real-time 
data. 
•Real-time BI enables users to employ multidimensional 
analysis, data mining, and decision support systems to 
analyze data in real time. In addition, it helps 
organizations to make decisions and to interact with 
customers in new ways.

Data Governance
 Data Governance: is an approach to managing information across 
an entire organization involving a formal set of unambiguous rules for 
creating, collecting, handling, and protecting its information.One strategy 
for implementing data governance is Master Data Management.
 Master Data Management: a strategy for data governance 
involving a process that spans all organizational business processes and 
applications providing companies with the ability to store, maintain, 
exchange, and synchronize a consistent, accurate, and timely for the 
company’s master data.
 Master Data: a set of core data (e.g., customer, product, employee, 
vendor, geographic location, etc.) that span the enterprise information 
systems.
● Businesses first adopted computer applications (mid-1950s) until the 
early 1970s, organizations managed their data in a file management 
environment.
 ● Each application required its own data, which were organized in a data 
file.
 ● A data file is a collection of logically related records.
 ● In a file management environment,each application has a specific data 
file related to it. 
● This file contains all of the data records the application requires.
 Using databases eliminates many problems that arose from previous 
methods of storing and accessing data, such as file management systems.
The Database 
Approach
 3.2
 •Data File
 •Database Systems Minimize & 
Maximize Three Things
 •The Data Hierarchy
 •The Relational Database Model
Database Management 
Systems (DBMS) Minimize:
 ● Data redundancy: The same data are stored in 
multiple locations.
 • Data isolation: Applications cannot access data 
associated with other applications.
 • Data inconsistency: Various copies of the data 
do not agree.
Database Management 
Systems (DBMS) Maximize:
 •Data Security: Because data are “put in one place” in 
databases, there is a risk of losing a lot of data at once. 
Therefore, databases have extremely high security measures 
in place to minimize mistakes and deter attacks.
 •Data integrity: Data meet certain constraints; for example, 
there are no alphabetic characters in a Social Security number 
field.
 •Data independence: Applications and data are independent of 
one another; that is, applications and data are not linked to 
each other, so all applications are able to access the same 
data.

 •Diverse, high volume, high-velocity 
information assets that require new 
forms of processing to enable 
enhanced decision making, insight 
discovery, and process optimization. 
Defining Big Data: The Big 
Data Institute (TBDI)
 •Vast Datasets that:–Exhibit variety–Include structured, unstructured, and 
semi-structured data–Generated at high velocity with an uncertain 
pattern–Do not fit neatly into traditional, structured, 
relational databases–Can be captured, processed, transformed, and 
analyzed in a reasonable amount of time only 
by sophisticated information systems.
Examples of Big Data
 Big Data generally consists of the following:
• Traditional enterprise data—examples are customer information from 
customer relationship management systems, transactional enterprise 
resource planning data, Web store transactions, operations data, and 
general ledger data.
 • Machine-generated/sensor data—examples are smart meters; 
manufacturing sensors; sensors integrated into smartphones, automobiles, 
airplane engines, and industrial machines; equipment logs; and trading 
systems data.
 • Social data—examples are customer feedback comments; microblogging 
sites such as Twitter; and social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube, 
and LinkedIn.
 • Images captured by billions of devices located throughout the world, 
from digital cameras and camera phones to medical scanners and security 
cameras.
Characteristics of Big Data
 • Volume: incredible volume of data.
 • Velocity: The rate at which data flow into an organization is rapidly 
increasing and it is critical because it increases the speed of the 
feedback loop between a company and its customers. 
• Variety: Big Data formats change rapidly and can include include 
satellite imagery, broadcast audio streams, digital music files, Web page 
content.
Issues with Big Data
 ● Big Data can come from untrusted sources.
 ● Big Data is dirty: Dirty data refers to inaccurate, incomplete, incorrect, 
duplicate, or erroneous data.
 ● Big Data changes, especially in data streams: Organizations must be 
aware that data quality in an analysis can change, or the data itself can 
change, because the conditions under which the data are captured can 
change.
Managing Big Data
 •Big Data can reveal valuable 
patterns, trends, and information 
that were previously hidden:–tracking the spread of disease–tracking crime–detecting fraud

value
 •Making Big Data Available
 •Enabling Organizations to Conduct 
Experiments
 •Micro-Segmentation of Customers
 •Creating New Business Models
 •Organizations Can Analyze Far More 
Data
Making Big Data Available: Making Big Data available for relevant stakeholders 
can help organizations gain value.
 Enabling Organizations to Conduct Experiments: Big Data allows 
organizations to improve performance by conducting controlled experiments. For 
example, Amazon (and many other companies such as Google and LinkedIn) 
constantly experiments by offering slight different “looks” on its Web site.
 Micro-Segmentation of Customers: Segmentation of a company’s customers 
means dividing them up into groups that share one or more characteristics.
 Creating New Business Models: 
• Companies are able to use Big Data to create new business models. 
• For example, a commercial transportation company operated a large fleet of 
large, long-haul trucks. The company recently placed sensors on all its 
trucks. These sensors wirelessly communicate large amounts of information 
to the company, a process called telematics. The sensors collect data on 
vehicle usage (including acceleration, braking, cornering, etc.), driver 
performance, and vehicle maintenance. 
• By analyzing this Big Data, the transportation company was able to improve 
the condition of its trucks through near-real-time analysis that proactively 
suggested preventive maintenance.
Organizations Can Analyze Far More Data: In some cases, organizations can 
even process all the data in a population relating to a particular phenomenon, 
meaning that they do not have to rely as much on sampling.

(OLAP)
 •Integrated
 •Time variant

•Multidimensional
Data Warehouse: a repository of historical data that are organized by 
subject to support decision makers in the organization.
 Data Mart: a low-cost, scaled-down version of a data warehouse that is 
designed for the end-user needs in a strategic business unit (SBU) or an 
individual department.
 Basic Characteristics of Data Warehouses and Data Marts:
 Organized by business dimension or subject - Data are organized by 
subject. For example, by customer, vendor, product, price level, and region. 
This arrangement differs from transactional systems, where data are 
organized by business process, such as order entry, inventory control, and 
accounts receivable.
 Use online analytical processing (OLAP): involves analysis of 
accumulated data by end users.
 Integrated - Data are collected from multiple systems and then integrated 
around subjects.
Time variant - Data warehouses and data marts maintain historical data (i.e., 
data that include time as a variable).
 Nonvolatile - Data warehouses and data marts are nonvolatile—that is, 
users cannot change or update the data.
 Multidimensional - Typically the data warehouse or mart uses a 
multidimensional data structure. Recall that relational databases store data in 
two-dimensional tables.

Source Systems: Systems that provide a source of organizational data. 
Common Examples of Source Systems Include:
 • operational/transactional systems
 • enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
 • Web site data
 • third-party data (e.g., customer demographic data)
 • operational databases
 Data Integration: reflects the growing number of ways that source system 
data can be handled. Typically organizations need to Extract, Transform, 
and Load (ETL) data from source system into a data warehouse or data 
mart.
 Storing the Data: A variety of architectures can be used to store 
decision-support data and the most common architecture is one central 
enterprise data warehouse, without data marts.
 Metadata: data maintained about the data within the data warehouse. 
(e.g., database, table, and column names; refresh schedules; and 
data-usage measures.
Data Quality: quality of the data in the warehouse must meet users’ 
needs. If it does not, users will not trust the data and ultimately will not use 
it. Some of the data can be improved with data-cleansing software, but the 
better, long-term solution is to improve the quality at the source system 
level.
 Governance: To ensure that BI is meeting their needs, organizations must 
implement governance to plan and control their BI activities. Governance 
requires that people, committees, and processes be in place.
 Users: There are many potential BI users, including IT developers; 
frontline workers; analysts; information workers; managers and executives; 
and suppliers, customers, and regulators.

Need:ESTABLISHING AN INFORMATION POLICY
 ● Every business, large and small, needs an information policy. 
● Firm’s data are an important resource
 ● Need to have rules on how the data are to be organized and 
maintained, and who is allowed to view the data or change 
them.
 INFORMATION POLICY
 ● An information policy specifies the organization’s rules for 
sharing, disseminating, acquiring, standardizing, classifying, 
and inventorying information. 
● Information policy lays out specific procedures and 
accountabilities, identifying which users and organizational 
units can share information, where information can be 
distributed, and who is responsible for updating and 
maintaining the information. 
● In a small business, the information policy would be 
established and implemented by the owners or managers. 
MANAGING DATA RESOURCES
● In a large organization, managing and planning for information 
as a corporate resource often requires a formal data 
administration function.
 Data administration 
● It is responsible for the specific policies and procedures 
through which data can be managed as an organizational 
resource. 
● These responsibilities include developing information policy, 
planning for data, overseeing logical database design and data 
dictionary development, and monitoring how information 
systems specialists and end-user groups use data. 
Data governance used to describe many of these activities. 
Data governance 
● Deals with the policies and processes for managing the 
availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data 
employed in an enterprise, with special emphasis on 
promoting privacy, security, data quality, and compliance with 
government regulations. 
● A large organization will also have a database design and 
management group within the corporate information systems 
division that is responsible for defining and organizing the 
structure and content of the database, and maintaining the 
database. 
● In close cooperation with users, the design group establishes 
the physical database, the logical relations among elements, 
and the access rules and security procedures. The functions 
it performs are called database administration. 
● A well-designed database and information policy will go a long 
way toward ensuring that the business has the information it 
needs. However, additional steps must be taken to ensure that 
the data in organizational databases are accurate and remain 
reliable.
 ● Data that are inaccurate, untimely, or inconsistent with other 
sources of information lead to incorrect decisions, product 
recalls, and financial losses. Inaccurate data in criminal justice 
and national security databases might even subject you to 
unnecessarily surveillance or detention.
 ● Database must be properly designed and enterprise-wide data 
standards established, so that the duplicate or inconsistent data 
elements should be minimal.
 ● Most data quality problems, however, such as misspelled 
names, transposed numbers, or incorrect or missing codes, 
stem from errors during data input. The incidence of such errors 
is rising as companies move their businesses to the Web and 
allow customers and suppliers to enter data into their Web sites 
that directly update internal systems. 
ENSURING DATA QUALITY
● Before a new database is in place, organizations need to 
identify and correct their faulty data and establish better 
routines for editing data once their database is in 
operation. Analysis of data quality often begins with a 
data quality audit, which is a structured survey of the 
accuracy and level of completeness of the data in an 
information system.
 ● Data quality audits can be performed by surveying 
entire data files, surveying samples from data files, or 
surveying end users for their perceptions of data quality. 
● Data cleansing, also known as data scrubbing, consists 
of activities for detecting and correcting data in a 
database that are incorrect, incomplete, improperly 
formatted, or redundant. 
● Data cleansing not only corrects errors but also enforces 
consistency among different sets of data that originated in 
separate information systems. Specialized data-cleansing 
software is available to automatically survey data files, 
correct errors in the data, and integrate the data in a 
consistent company-wide format. 
● Data quality problems are not just business 
problems. They also pose serious problems for 
individuals, affecting their financial condition and 
even their jobs. 
● The Interactive Session on Organizations describes 
some of these impacts, as it details the data quality 
problems found in the companies that collect and 
report consumer credit data. 
● As you read this case, look for the management, 
organization, and technology factors behind this 
problem, and whether existing solutions are 
adequate.

 •The KMS Cycle
Concepts and Definitions
 •Knowledge Management
 •Knowledge
 •Explicit and Tacit Knowledge
 •Knowledge Management Systems
 •The KMS Cycle
Knowledge management (KM): a process that helps organizations manipulate 
important knowledge that comprises part of the organization’s Knowledge: 
information that is contextual, relevant, and useful. It is information in action. 
Intellectual capital (or intellectual assets) is another term for knowledge.
 Explicit Knowledge: more objective, rational, and technical knowledge. In an 
organization, explicit knowledge consists of the policies, procedural guides, 
reports, products, strategies, goals, core competencies, and IT infrastructure of 
the enterprise.
 Tacit Knowledge: the cumulative store of subjective or experiential learning. In 
an organization, tacit knowledge consists of an organization’s experiences, 
insights, expertise, know-how, trade secrets, skill sets, understanding, and 
learning. It is generally imprecise and costly to transfer.
 Knowledge management systems (KMSs): refer to the use of modern 
information technologies—the Internet, intranets, extranets, databases—to 
systematize, enhance, and expedite intra-firm and inter-firm knowledge 
management. KMSs are intended to help an organization cope with turnover, 
rapid change, and downsizing by making the expertise of the organization’s 
human capital widely accessible.
The KMS Cycle Consists of Six Steps:
 Create knowledge: Knowledge is created as people determine new ways of 
doing things or develop know-how. Sometimes external knowledge is brought 
in.
 Capture knowledge: New knowledge must be identified as valuable and be 
represented in a reasonable way.
 Refine knowledge: New knowledge must be placed in context so that it is 
actionable. This is where tacit qualities (human insights) must be captured 
along with explicit facts.
 Store knowledge: Useful knowledge must then be stored in a reasonable 
format in a knowledge repository so that other people in the organization can 
access it.
 Manage knowledge: Like a library, the knowledge must be kept current. It 
must be reviewed regularly to verify that it is relevant and accurate.
 Disseminate knowledge: Knowledge must be made available in a useful 
format to anyone in the organization who needs it, anywhere and anytime.

right and wrong that individuals use 
to make choices that guide their 
behavior. 
2. Deciding what is right or wrong is 
not always easy or clear cut. 
Fortunately, 
there 
are 
many 
frameworks that can help us make 
ethical decisions.
Ethical Issues 6.1
 •Ethical Frameworks
 •Ethics in the Corporate 
Environment
 •Ethics and Information 
Technology
Ethical Frameworks
 Sources of Ethical standards are:
•Utilitarian Approach
 •Rights Approach
 •Fairness Approach
 •Common Good Approach
 •Five Steps of the General Ethical 
Framework
Utilitarian approach
 1. The utilitarian approach states that an ethical 
action is the one that provides the most good or 
does the least harm. 
2. The ethical corporate action would be the one that 
produces the greatest good and does the least 
harm 
for 
all 
affected 
parties—customers, 
employees, shareholders, the community, and the 
environment
Rights approach
 1. The rights approach maintains that an ethical 
action is the one that best protects and respects 
the moral rights of the affected parties.
 2. Moral rights can include the rights to make one’s 
own choices about what kind of life to lead, to be 
told the truth, not to be injured, and to a degree 
of privacy
 3. An ethical organizational action would be one that 
protects and respects the moral rights of 
customers, employees, shareholders, business 
partners, and even competitors.
Fairness approach
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 The fairness approach posts that ethical actions 
treat all human beings equally, or, if unequally, then 
fairly, based on some defensible standard.
 For example, most people might believe it is fair to 
pay people higher salaries if they work harder or if 
they contribute a greater amount to the firm.
 However, there is less certainty regarding CEO 
salaries that are hundreds or thousands of times 
larger than those of other employees. 
Many people question whether this huge disparity is 
based on a defensible standard or whether it is the 
result of an imbalance of power and hence is unfair
Common good approach
 1. The common good approach highlights the 
interlocking relationships that underlie all 
societies. 
2. This approach argues that respect and 
compassion for all others is the basis for 
ethical actions.
 3. It emphasizes the common conditions that 
are important to the welfare of everyone.
 4. These conditions can include a system of 
laws, 
effective 
police 
departments,healthcare, 
a 
and 
fire 
public 
educational system, and even public 
recreation areas.
Five Steps of the General 
Ethical Framework
 1. Recognize the Issue
 2. Get the Facts
 3. Evaluate Alternative Actions
 4. Make a Decision and Test It
 5. Act and Reflect on the Outcome of 
Your Decision
Recognize the Issue
 1. Could this decision or situation 
damage someone or some group?
 2. Does this decision involve a choice 
between a good and a bad 
alternative?
 3. Does this issue involve more than 
legal considerations? If so, in what 
way?
Get the Facts
 1. What are the relevant facts of the 
situation?
 2. Do I have sufficient information to 
make a decision?
 3. Which individuals and/or groups 
have an important stake in the 
outcome?
 4. Have I consulted all relevant 
persons and groups?
Evaluate alternative actions
 1. Which option will produce the most 
good and do the least harm? (the 
utilitarian approach)
 2. Which option best respects the rights 
of 
all 
stakeholders? 
(the 
rights 
approach)
 3. Which option treats people equally or 
proportionally? (the fairness approach)
 4. Which option best serves the 
community as a whole, and not just 
some members? (the
    common good approach)
Make a decision and test it
 1. Considering all the approaches, 
which option best addresses the 
situation?
 1. How can I implement my decision with 
the greatest care and attention to the 
concerns of all stakeholders?
 2. How did my decision turn out, and 
what did I learn from this specific 
situation?
 Act and reflect on the 
outcome of your decision
Ethics in the Corporate 
Environment
 ●Many companies and professional 
organizations develop their own codes of 
ethics. 
●A code of ethics is a collection of 
principles intended to guide decision 
making by members of the organization.
Ethics in the Corporate 
Environment
 • Fundamental Tenets of Ethics–Responsibility:means that you accept the 
consequences of your decisions and actions.–Accountability:refers to determining who is 
responsible for actions that were taken.–Liability:a legal concept that gives individuals 
the right to recover the damages done to 
them by other individuals, organizations, or 
systems.
’S ABOUT BUSINESS 6.1
 •Cheating Is Risky 
for Business 
Students
 1. As the Turnitin database expands rapidly by 
incorporating a growing number of papers 
and essays, what will be the impact on 
subsequent papers submitted to it?
 2. Discuss the ethical implications of writing a 
paper yourself that you know contains some 
plagiarized material and then using 
Turnitin’s service yourself.
Ethics and Information Technology
 Consider the following decisions that 
you might have to make:
 ✔Should organizations monitor 
employees’ Web surfing and e-mail?
 ✔Should organizations sell customer 
information to other companies?
 ✔Should organizations audit 
employees’ computers for 
unauthorized software or illegally 
downloaded music or video files?
The diversity and ever-expanding use of IT 
applications have created a variety of ethical 
issues. 
These issues fall into four general categories: 
privacy, accuracy, property, and accessibility. 
1. Privacy issues involve collecting, storing, and 
disseminating information about individuals. 
2. Accuracy issues involve the authenticity, 
fidelity, and correctness of information that is 
collected and processed. 
3. Property issues involve the ownership and 
value of information. 
4. Accessibility issues revolve around who 
should have access to information and whether 
a fee should be paid for this access.
Privacy Issues
 1.
 What information about oneself should an 
individual be required to reveal to others?
 2. What kind of surveillance can an employer 
use on its employees?
 3. What types of personal information can 
people keep to themselves and not be forced 
to reveal to others?
 4. What information about individuals should be 
kept in databases, and how secure is the 
information there?
Accuracy Issues
 1.
 2.
 3.
 4.
 Who is responsible for the authenticity, fidelity, and 
accuracy of the information collected?
 How can we ensure that the information will be 
processed properly and presented accurately to 
users?
 How can we ensure that errors in databases, data 
transmissions, and data processing are accidental 
and not intentional?
 Who is to be held accountable for errors in 
information, and how should the injured parties be 
compensated?
Property Issues
 1.
 Who owns the information?
 2. What are the just and fair prices for its 
exchange?
 3. How should we handle software piracy (copying 
copyrighted software)?
 4. Under what circumstances can one use 
proprietary databases?
 5. Can corporate computers be used for private 
purposes?
 6. How should experts who contribute their 
knowledge to create expert systems be
 7.
 compensated?
 8. How should access to information channels be 
allocated?
Accessibility Issues
 1.
 Who is allowed to access information?
 2. How much should companies charge for 
permitting access to information?
 3. How can access to computers be provided for 
employees with disabilities?
 4. Who will be provided with equipment needed for 
accessing information?
 5. What information does a person or an 
organization have a right to obtain, under what 
conditions, and with what safeguards?
Privacy
 • Privacy: the right to be left alone and to 
be free of unreasonable personal 
intrusions.
 • Information privacy is the right to 
determine when, and to what extent, 
information about you can be gathered 
and/or communicated to others. 
•Privacy rights apply to individuals, 
Groups, and institutions. 
•Court decisions in many countries have 
generally followed two rules–The right to privacy is not absolute–The public’s right to know supersedes 
the individual’s right to privacy.

 •Personal Information in Databases
 •Information on Internet Bulletin 
Boards, Newsgroups, and Social 
Networking Sites
 •Privacy Codes and Policies
 •International Aspects of Privacy
Electronic Surveillance
 • Electronic surveillance is rapidly increasing 
with the emergence of new technologies
 • Emerging Technologies increase monitoring of 
human activity
 • Surveillance cameras track you at airports, 
subways, banks, and other public venues. 
• Inexpensive digital sensors are now  
incorporated into laptop webcams, 
video-game motion sensors, smartphone 
cameras, utility meters, passports, employee 
ID cards 
• high-resolution photographs taken from the 
air or from the street by Google or Microsoft 
Electronic Surveillance
 • your license plates will be recorded and time-stamped as you 
drive down a city street, cross a toll bridge, or park at a 
shopping mall.
 • Google and Facebook are using facial-recognition 
software—Google Picasa and Facebook
 • Photo Albums—in their popular online photo-editing and 
sharing services. Both companies encourage users to assign 
names to people in photos, a practice referred to as photo 
tagging
 • The law supports the right of employers to read their 
employees’ e-mail and other electronic documents and to 
monitor their employees’ Internet use.
 • organizations routinely monitor their employees’ Internet 
usage. In addition, two-thirds use software to block 
connections to inappropriate Websites, a practice called URL 
filtering. Further, organizations are installing monitoring and 
filtering software to enhance security by blocking malicious 
software and to increase productivity by discouraging 
employees from wasting time

Personal Information in 
Databases
 • Modern institutions store information about 
individuals in many databases. Perhaps the 
most visible locations of such records are 
credit-reporting agencies,banks and financial 
institutions; cable TV, telephone, and utilities 
companies; employers; mortgage companies; 
hospitals; schools and universities; retail 
establishments;government agencies
 
• Major Concerns:–Do you know where the records are?–Are the records accurate?
Personal Information in 
Databases (continued)
 •Major Concerns:–Can you change inaccurate data?–How long will it take to make a change?–Under what circumstances will the 
personal data be released?–How are the data used?–To whom are the data given or sold?–How secure are the data against access by 
unauthorized people?
Information on Internet Bulletin Boards, 
Newsgroups, and Social Networking Sites
 • Every day we see more and more electronic bulletin 
boards, newsgroups, electronic discussions such 
as chat rooms, and social networking sites. These 
sites appear on the Internet, within corporate 
intranets, and on blogs.
 • Blog (Web Log): an informal, personal journal that is 
frequently updated and is intended for general public 
reading.
 • Conflict between free speech and privacy than 
the Internet. Many Web sites contain anonymous, 
derogatory information on individuals, who typically 
have little recourse in the matter.
 • Weblog
 • Free Speech versus Privacy

Privacy Codes and Policies
 • Privacy Policies (or Privacy Codes): an organization’s guidelines 
for protecting the privacy of its customers, clients, and employees.
 • Opt-Out Model of Informed Consent: permits the company to 
collect personal information until the customer specifically requests 
that the data not be collected. 
• Opt-In Model of Informed Consent: Privacy advocates prefer 
this model, which prohibits an organization from collecting any 
personal information unless the customer specifically authorizes it.
 • Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P): a protocol that 
automatically communicates privacy policies between an electronic 
commerce Web site and visitors to that site. P3P enables visitors to 
determine the types of personal data that can be extracted by the 
sites they visit.
